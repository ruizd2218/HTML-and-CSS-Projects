			<i><p> I love lemonade, it's one of my <u><span>favorite</span></u> drinks.</p></i>
			<p> Modern lemonade was first held in tanks on merchant's backs, sold and dispensed in Paris in the 1600s, however, Lemonade can 
			be traced back to Ancient Egypt, in these times, it was simply just water, lemon,
			and a form of sweetener, which could have been either honey or dates. Nowadays, Lemonade is sweetened and preserved
			with plenty of chemicals that probably aren't very good for us. It makes you wonder what old lemonade must have tasted like.<br>
			I can understand if you think plain old lemonade can get boring, but that's why we have other flavors, such as strawberry and raspberry Lemonade, these add to and
			compliment the taste perfectly.</p>
