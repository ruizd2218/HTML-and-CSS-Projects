	<i><p>Hello, this is an HTML spacing challenge, the assignment requires
	that I have a <span style="color:blue">word break</span>, <span style="color:green">a section</span>, a 
	<span style="color:red">span tag</span> and a <span style="color:orange">character entity</span><br></i>
	
	</br>If you aren't sure what a character entity is, it's a short code that allows me to put symbols like
	this - &copy<br>
	
	</br>It is currently 2:16&nbspPM</p>
